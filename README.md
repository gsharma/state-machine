# Finite State Machine

An implementation of a simple and hopefully elegant (from a user's perspective) FSM that allows both forward and backwards state transitions. At the moment, idempotency of state transitions is completely ignored. This could change and the machine could be enhanced to handle retries for idempotent state transitions.

Note that this is presently BETA quality software and still evolving which makes it not yet ready for broad consumption. The API contract is also prone to changes.
